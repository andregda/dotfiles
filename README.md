## ZSH

**Fast umbloated ZSH config achieved by:**
- Loading `compinit` once a day, not every single instance</br>
- Adding only the pluggins that you really use</br>
- No manager to overload your system</br>

**Not ready to ditch your zsh plugin manager ?**
- Try forcing every `compinit load` to check whether the cached `.zcompdump` file needs to be regenerated based on daily intevals, i.e.

```bash
  [[ -n ${ZDOTDIR}/.zcompdump(#qN.mh+24) ]] && compinit || compinit -C
```
**No plugin manager necessary. Just download it and use it.** Heavly inspired by: [ChristianChiarulli/Machfiles](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/Machfiles/tree/master/zsh)

#### Give your config. a try by running:

    $ for i in $(seq 1 10); do time zsh -i -c exit; done
